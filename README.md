### Introduction
<hr>

This resource pack adds refreshed Animated Ore to your Minecraft world, something similar to the [Visuality](https://modrinth.com/mod/visuality) mod. They also have their variants, so there will be not just one, but several block textures. It also offers mod support, for now in a small amount, but in the future there will be added such mod support! They also have support for emissive, which is optional, even if you do not have a mod introducing this functionality will be used from the default resources included in the game or mod.
