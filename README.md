A resource pack that changes the appearance of regular vanilla and modded ores to animated ores. They are emissive.

### Emissive Compatibility
- Vanilla - ❌
    -  If you are looking for a vanilla version of emissive animated ores I invite you [here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/animated-ore-vanilla-emissive). Project is in alpha development as it is being rolled out with the release of snapshots for a future version, **1.21.2**.
- [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads)¹ - ✅
    - requires **Emissive Textures** to be enabled. (*The default is on*)
- [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity)¹ - ✅
    - required [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)² **0.6.0 or later** (*For now, it is in a preview version released as a beta version*)
    - required [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium)² **0.3.20 or later**, but only with [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector)
   - required [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)³ (only **older versions** of **Sodium than version 0.6.0**)
   - required [Lazurite](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazurite)³ (applies only to Forge 1.20.1. If you are using an older version of Embeddium **0.3.19 and lower**)
- [Connectedness](https://modrinth.com/mod/connectedness)¹ - ✅
    - required [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) (for action Reforgium, **only 1.19.2 and 1.18.2**)
    - required [Reforgium](https://modrinth.com/mod/reforgium)³

`¹` - Without these modifications, the resource pack will still work. It will use the resources contained in Minecraft Vanilla (*unmodified*). The only thing you won't experience is the resource pack emissive features.

`²` - The FRAPI interface has been implemented.

`³` - Mods that are required. Without them, Minecraft will not start or will crash.
