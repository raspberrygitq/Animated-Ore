# Compatibility 
- Minecraft Vanilla
- [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads)¹
    - requires Emissive Textures to be enabled. (*By default, it should be enabled*)
- [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity)¹ 
    - required [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)² (*soon Sodium 0.6*³, see [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/milestone/5))
    - required [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium), but only with [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector)

`¹` - Without these modifications, the resource pack will still work. It will use the resources contained in Minecraft Vanilla (*unmodified*). The only thing you won't experience is the resource pack emissive features.

`²` - Mods that are required. Without them, Minecraft will not start or will crash.

`³` - The FRAPI interface will soon be introduced, replacing Indium in the future.
